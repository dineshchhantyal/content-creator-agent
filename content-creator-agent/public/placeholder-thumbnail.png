The file public/placeholder-thumbnail.png is a placeholder image file. Since I cannot create image files directly, you will need to create a placeholder image manually or use an existing image. 

You can create a simple placeholder image using any image editing software or download a placeholder image from the internet and save it as placeholder-thumbnail.png in the specified directory. 

If you need a specific image or design for the placeholder, please provide the details, and I can guide you on how to create it.
